                <p>WHAT TO DO IF YOU'RE FAT:</p>
                <p>The first thing what you have to do is obviously go do some exercises to lose weight</p>
                <p>1. Start with cardio exercises like running on a treadmill, cycling or running. This helps lose you some weight but not entirely.</p>
                <p>2. Because number 2 is about nutrition on when you want to lose weight. You have to eat less calories than you burn. This is the most important thing</p>
                <p>Eat foods like tuna, shrimp or greek yoghurt to gain muscle and lose fat.</p>
